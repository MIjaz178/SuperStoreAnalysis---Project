Hello. 
The project contains a project report, a  project presentation (in pdf format) 
and a power BI file for reference and learning.

The project report shows all the steps i followed for my project and the end result
the presentation is the crux of the project and the sequence i followed to present my findings
the power BI file visually presents my data and findings visually
